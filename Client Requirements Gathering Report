Project: Fortune Home  
Date: 8 Aug 25
Attendees:  (Abhay,Rahul,Harsh,Parthesh), [Client Name: Nikunj Patel]

Introduction
On 8 Aug, our project team held a detailed requirements gathering meeting with the client, to clarify the scope, features, and design preferences for the upcoming real estate website. This document summarizes the key points discussed to ensure alignment on project goals and deliverables.

Project Objectives

The client emphasised that the main goal of the website is to create a user-friendly and efficient platform for prospective buyers and tenants to peruse property listings. The website should provide available homes in a visually appealing manner while also giving detailed information that stimulates user participation, such as contacting agents or scheduling viewings.

Property Types and Listings

The client plans to predominantly display residential properties such as houses, apartments, and townhouses. Furthermore, the website should include listings for commercial properties like office spaces and retail stores, as well as a smaller portfolio of vacant land parcels.

Search and Filtering Functionality
To enhance user experience, the client requires robust search and filtering options allowing users to narrow down properties based on:
•	Geographic location (city, suburb, neighborhood)
•	Price range with minimum and maximum values
•	Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
•	Property type (house, apartment, commercial, land)
•	Amenities such as swimming pools, parking availability, pet-friendliness, and garden/outdoor spaces
The goal is to enable users to quickly and easily find listings matching their specific preferences without wading through irrelevant results.

Property Details Page Requirements
Each property listing page should include:
•	A high-quality photo gallery highlighting the property’s interior and exterior
•	Clear display of asking or rental price
•	Detailed description outlining key features and selling points
•	Complete address with an embedded interactive map for easy location visualization
•	Floor plans, if available
•	Contact information of the responsible agent, including phone number and email
•	A call-to-action or form allowing users to request additional information or schedule a viewing appointment
The client expects these elements to provide users with sufficient information to build trust and motivate further action.

User Account Features
The client expressed interest in implementing user accounts to allow visitors to:
•	Register and manage personal profiles
•	Save favorite listings for easy access
•	Set up notifications or alerts for new listings matching their criteria
•	Potentially communicate with agents through an internal messaging system
However, the client acknowledges that these features may be deferred to a future phase following the initial website launch.

Design and Branding Guidelines
The client prefers a modern, clean, and professional design aesthetic. The website should predominantly use blue and white color schemes to align with existing branding. A minimalistic approach is favored, prioritizing usability and accessibility. The typography should be easy to read, with a preference for sans-serif fonts. Responsive design is critical, ensuring optimal functionality across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Technical Considerations
While the client does not mandate a specific technology stack, they emphasize the importance of scalability and ease of content management. Acceptable options include popular content management systems such as WordPress or a custom-built solution, provided it allows the client’s team to easily update content and manage listings. Security best practices must be observed, particularly regarding user data protection.

Additional Features and Integrations
The client highlighted the following additional desired features:
•	Integration with Google Maps for property location display
•	Social media sharing buttons on property listings
•	Potential future additions such as virtual tours and mortgage calculators, although these are not priorities for the initial launch

Next Steps
Our team will compile a detailed requirements specification document incorporating the client’s feedback, along with wireframes and technical architecture proposals. These will be submitted for client review and approval before development begins.

Conclusion
The meeting provided clear and comprehensive insights into the client’s expectations and requirements. Our team is committed to delivering a solution that aligns closely with these needs and look forward to progressing to the next stages of the project.
