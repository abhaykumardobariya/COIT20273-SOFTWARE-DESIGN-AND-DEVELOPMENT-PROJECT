UI/UX Designer — Parthesh

As the UI/UX Designer for our project, my role was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design for the real estate website.

I began by designing wireframes for the three most important pages — the Homepage, the Search Results page, and the Property Details page — to plan the layout before moving into detailed design.

Once approved, I created high-fidelity mockups that defined the colours, typography, and styles for the site. I also developed a visual style guide to ensure design consistency across all pages, including colour palette, fonts, button styles, and form elements.

I ensured responsiveness so the design adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, and followed accessibility standards (WCAG) to make the site usable for all visitors.

Finally, I collaborated with the front-end developer, providing design assets, measurements, and specifications using tools like Figma.

My research focused on UI/UX best practices for real estate websites, the use of tools such as Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch, and responsive web design techniques including flexible grids, fluid images, and media queries.
