## Contribution by: Harsh

As the Frontend Developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the visual and interactive elements of the Fortune Homes Victoria website. My key contributions are outlined below:

### Page Development
Developed all five main pages using semantic HTML5:

index.html – Home

services.html – Services

projects.html – Project Gallery

testimonials.html – Client Feedback

contact.html – Contact Form and Google Maps embed

### Styling and Layout
Designed and implemented a responsive layout using CSS3 and Bootstrap 5.

Applied a consistent visual style aligned with Fortune Homes Victoria's branding (color scheme, fonts, spacing).

Ensured all layouts adapt fluidly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (mobile-first design).

Created a modern, professional look using CSS Flexbox/Grid and Bootstrap components (navbar, cards, buttons).

### Interactivity and Features
Integrated Lightbox.js to create a visually engaging project gallery with enlarged image view.

Embedded a Google Map on the Contact page to display the business location.

Implemented a contact form using Formspree, with client-side validation for input fields using JavaScript.

Developed a responsive navigation bar with a collapsible hamburger menu for smaller devices.

### Optimization and Compatibility
Optimized website performance by compressing images and reducing unnecessary scripts.

Ensured cross-browser compatibility (tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Maintained accessibility standards by using alt attributes for images, appropriate color contrasts, and keyboard-navigable links.

### Testing and QA
Conducted:

Functional testing of all links and forms.

Responsive testing across different screen sizes and resolutions.

Usability testing to ensure intuitive navigation and layout consistency.

### Deployment
