Designed and implemented a responsive layout using CSS3 and Bootstrap 5.

Applied a consistent visual style aligned with Fortune Homes Victoria's branding (color scheme, fonts, spacing).

Ensured all layouts adapt fluidly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (mobile-first design).

Created a modern, professional look using CSS Flexbox/Grid and Bootstrap components (navbar, cards, buttons).
