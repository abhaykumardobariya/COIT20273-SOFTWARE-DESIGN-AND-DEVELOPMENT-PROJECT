Introduction
This report outlines the steps and strategies our project team will undertake to demonstrate genuine involvement, leadership, and accountability in the development of the Fortune Home real estate website. Despite outsourcing the coding work, we are committed to managing the project professionally and transparently, ensuring our professor and stakeholders trust that we are actively contributing to the project’s success.
 
1. Deep Understanding of Project Details
To build credibility, it is essential that we fully comprehend the project’s scope, client requirements, and the purpose of each feature. Our team has taken the following measures:
•	Conducted thorough requirements gathering sessions with the client, documenting all functional and non-functional needs.
•	Prepared detailed reports explaining how each feature adds value to the end-user and aligns with the client’s business objectives.
•	Studied the technical architecture and design decisions to understand the “why” behind each choice, enabling us to explain it confidently.
Benefit: This deep understanding enables us to answer questions accurately and demonstrate ownership beyond superficial knowledge.
 
2. Regular and Professional Communication
Maintaining transparency with both the client and our professor is key to building trust. Our approach includes:
•	Sending regular, well-structured progress reports summarizing completed tasks, upcoming work, challenges faced, and mitigation strategies.
•	Using clear and professional language in all communications to convey seriousness and commitment.
•	Sharing meeting agendas before sessions and detailed minutes afterward with action items and deadlines.
Benefit: These practices show that the project is actively managed and that we are accountable for timelines and deliverables.
 
3. Leadership in Team Meetings and Task Management
Though coding is outsourced, our internal team coordination remains critical. We:
•	Schedule and lead weekly internal meetings to track progress, discuss issues, and reassign tasks if necessary.
•	Document each meeting thoroughly and distribute notes to ensure transparency and follow-through.
•	Utilize project management tools (e.g., Trello or Asana) to assign responsibilities, monitor progress, and maintain accountability.
Benefit: Demonstrates proactive leadership and an organized project management approach.
 
4. Project Planning and Risk Management
To showcase managerial skills, we have developed:
•	A detailed project timeline with milestones, deadlines, and dependencies clearly mapped.
•	Risk assessment logs identifying potential issues and contingency plans to address them promptly.
•	Regular updates to the project plan reflecting any client changes or unforeseen delays.
Benefit: Shows a professional approach to managing complexity and maintaining project control.
 
5. Ownership of Client Communication
As the primary interface between client and team, our responsibilities include:
•	Coordinating client meetings to clarify requirements, confirm changes, and gather feedback.
•	Preparing meeting agendas and follow-up documents that record decisions and next steps.
•	Managing client expectations and negotiating scope adjustments diplomatically.
Benefit: Positions us as the reliable point-person, reinforcing our active project involvement.
 
6. Understanding Technical Aspects
To convincingly lead the project, we have:
•	Familiarized ourselves with the chosen technology stack, tools, and frameworks used by the outsourced developers.
•	Learned to translate technical jargon into understandable language for clients and professors alike.
•	Reviewed delivered work to ensure it meets specified requirements and quality standards.
Benefit: Enables effective quality assurance and informed communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
 
7. Presentation and Defense Preparation
To effectively demonstrate our contributions, we will:
•	Prepare a clear and concise presentation covering our project management approach, client interactions, and oversight activities.
•	Anticipate potential questions from the professor regarding our role and provide honest, detailed answers.
•	Use visual aids such as timelines, meeting minutes, and reports as evidence of our active engagement.
Benefit: Reinforces credibility and professionalism during evaluations.
 
Additional Recommendations
To further strengthen trust, our team is considering:
•	Taking on smaller, tangible project tasks such as writing documentation, conducting testing, or preparing demo scripts ourselves.
•	Encouraging open feedback from the professor and client to continuously improve our processes and communication.
 
Conclusion
By implementing the above strategies, our team aims to clearly demonstrate that we are not passive observers but active leaders and managers of the Fortune Home website project. Our commitment to thorough understanding, transparent communication, organized task management, and professional client interaction will establish trust with our professor and contribute to a successful project outcome.
 
If needed, we are prepared to provide all supporting documentation and records to validate our efforts throughout the project lifecycle.
