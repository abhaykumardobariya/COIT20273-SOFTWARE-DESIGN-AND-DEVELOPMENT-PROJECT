# UI/UX Designer – Fortune Living Victoria (Real Estate Web Application)

## Role Overview
As the **UI/UX Designer** for this project, I was responsible for shaping the overall user experience and visual design of the application. My work focused on ensuring the platform is intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing for all users (visitors, agents, and admins).

- Property search and filter pages  
- Property details with image gallery, enquiry, and inspection forms  
- Agent dashboard, login, and listing management  
- Admin role management and master data screens
