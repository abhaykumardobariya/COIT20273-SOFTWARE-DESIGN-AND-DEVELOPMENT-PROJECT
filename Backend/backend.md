**Introduction**
For our real estate website project, my job is to build and manage the parts of the site that run in the background — the database, the admin panel, form handling — and to test everything to make sure it works well. If the back-end isn’t solid, the site won’t be able to handle property listings, client inquiries, or future updates. This plan will help me learn what I need and apply it directly to our project.

**Step-by-Step Plan**
I’ll start by learning how websites work on the server side — how they store data, send it to the front-end, and process things like forms.
Database Design
I’ll learn how to design a database for property listings, inquiries, and testimonials, and how the tables link together.
Handling Forms & Sending Emails
I’ll learn how to process the inquiry form securely and send email notifications to the business.
Learn Testing Methods
I’ll learn different types of testing — unit testing (small pieces), integration testing (parts working together), and user testing.
Use Testing Tools
I’ll practice using tools like Postman (for checking APIs).
Version Control with Git
I’ll learn how to use Git and GitHub to keep track of code changes and avoid overwriting work.

**How I’ll Work on This**

I’ll go through each step in order.
I’ll build and test features at the same time.
I’ll write down what I learn and keep updating the admin guide.
I’ll work closely with the front-end developer to make sure everything connects well.

Always test locally before uploading changes.
Keep backups of the database.
Check for security issues every time I add new features.
Share testing results with the team so we can fix problems early.
